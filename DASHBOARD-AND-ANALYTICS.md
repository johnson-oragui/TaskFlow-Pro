## **1. Core Concept of Dashboard and Analytics**

The **Dashboard and Analytics** section of the application will provide key metrics related to the project and team’s performance.
This will allow users to visualize and track task completion rates, user productivity, overdue tasks, and other important data points in real-time.

The dashboard will aggregate data from the system to offer reports that can help managers and teams improve efficiency and performance.

### **Purpose of Dashboard and Analytics:**
- **Visual Insights**: Show metrics such as completed tasks, overdue tasks, pending tasks, and team productivity.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Allow teams and managers to make informed decisions based on the real-time and historical data.
- **Track Progress**: Give an overview of task statuses (To Do, In Progress, Done) and help monitor deadlines.
- **User Productivity**: Track individual user activity and task completion to identify high performers or underperforming team members.

## **2. Key Analytics and Dashboard Metrics**

The dashboard will present a variety of metrics to provide insights into task management and team performance. Key metrics include:

### **Task Metrics**:
1. **Total Tasks**: The total number of tasks in the system, across all teams and projects.
2. **Completed Tasks**: Number of tasks marked as "Done."
3. **Overdue Tasks**: Tasks that have passed their due date and are still not completed.
4. **Tasks by Status**: A breakdown of tasks by their current status (To Do, In Progress, Done).
5. **Tasks by Priority**: A breakdown of tasks by priority (Low, Medium, High).
6. **Tasks by Due Date**: A count of tasks grouped by their due dates.

### **Team Metrics**:
1. **Team Performance**: Average completion rate of tasks for each team.
2. **Team Workload**: Distribution of tasks among team members (who has the most tasks, etc.).
3. **Tasks Per Team Member**: The number of tasks assigned to each team member.

### **User Metrics**:
1. **User Productivity**: Number of tasks completed by each user within a specific timeframe.
2. **Active Users**: The number of users actively working on tasks.
3. **Top Performers**: Users who have completed the most tasks in a specific period.
4. **User Workload**: The distribution of tasks per user, helping identify overloaded or underutilized team members.

### **Time-based Analytics**:
1. **Weekly/Monthly Reports**: Tasks completed, overdue, or in progress over weekly/monthly periods.
2. **Average Task Completion Time**: The average time taken for users to complete a task from start to finish.
3. **Task Completion by Deadline**: Percentage of tasks completed on time versus those overdue.

## **3. Database Modeling for Analytics**

In order to efficiently generate the analytics and dashboard metrics, certain data needs to be stored and queried.
These metrics may require data from multiple related tables such as **Tasks**, **Users**, **Teams**, and **Activity Logs**.

### **Task Table** (for status, priority, due date, etc.)
```sql
tasks
-----
id              UUID (PK)
team_id         UUID (FK to teams)
user_id         UUID (FK to users)
title           VARCHAR
description     TEXT
status          ENUM ('Todo', 'In Progress', 'Done')
priority        ENUM ('Low', 'Medium', 'High')
due_date        TIMESTAMP
created_at      TIMESTAMP
updated_at      TIMESTAMP
completed_at    TIMESTAMP (nullable)
```

### **User Table** (for individual user activity)
```sql
users
-----
id              UUID (PK)
email           VARCHAR
role            ENUM ('Admin', 'Manager', 'Member')
created_at      TIMESTAMP
```

### **Activity Logs Table** (for tracking task changes)
```sql
activity_logs
-------------
id              UUID (PK)
task_id         UUID (FK to tasks)
user_id         UUID (FK to users)
action          ENUM ('Created', 'Updated', 'Completed', 'Assigned', 'Deleted')
timestamp       TIMESTAMP
```

### **Columns Explanation**:
- **Tasks Table**: The `status`, `priority`, and `due_date` fields are key for generating task-related analytics.
- **Users Table**: Stores user data for identifying top performers, work distribution, etc.
- **Activity Logs Table**: Tracks all actions on tasks (e.g., creation, updates, completions) for auditing and reporting.

## **4. API Endpoints for Dashboard and Analytics**

The **Dashboard** section will be backed by several API endpoints that provide the required data for rendering the analytics.
These endpoints will aggregate and process the data from various tables and present it to the frontend in a suitable format.

### **API Endpoints**:

| Method | Endpoint                           | Description                                      |
|--------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/dashboard/metrics/tasks`        | Get task-related metrics (completed, overdue, etc.) |
| GET    | `/dashboard/metrics/team`         | Get team-related performance metrics              |
| GET    | `/dashboard/metrics/user`         | Get user-related productivity metrics             |
| GET    | `/dashboard/reports/weekly`       | Get weekly task report (completed, overdue)      |
| GET    | `/dashboard/reports/monthly`      | Get monthly task report (completed, overdue)     |
| GET    | `/dashboard/task/completion-time` | Get the average task completion time             |
| GET    | `/dashboard/tasks/status`         | Get tasks grouped by status                      |

## **5. Task Analytics Logic**

In order to generate the task-related analytics, A query to the **Tasks** and **Activity Logs** tables would be done and processing carried out on the results.

### **Task Status Breakdown**:
1. **Completed Tasks**: 
   - Filter tasks where `status = 'Done'`.
   - Query for the count of completed tasks within a specified date range (e.g., this week, this month).
   
2. **Overdue Tasks**:
   - Filter tasks where `status != 'Done'` and `due_date < NOW()`.
   - Query for tasks that are overdue.

3. **Tasks by Status**:
   - Query the tasks and group them by their `status` (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done").
   
4. **Tasks by Priority**:
   - Group tasks by `priority` and return the count for each.

5. **Tasks by Due Date**:
   - Group tasks by their `due_date` and return a count for each unique due date.

### **Example Query for Completed Tasks**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM tasks 
WHERE status = 'Done' 
AND completed_at BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30';
```

### **Example Query for Overdue Tasks**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM tasks 
WHERE status != 'Done' 
AND due_date < NOW();
```

## **6. User and Team Analytics Logic**

User and team productivity data can be fetched by querying the **Tasks** table and the **Activity Logs**.

### **User Productivity**:
- Track the number of tasks a user has completed within a given time period.
- Example query:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM tasks 
WHERE user_id = 'user-456' 
AND status = 'Done' 
AND completed_at BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30';
```

### **Top Performers**:
- Query for users who have completed the most tasks in a given period.
- Example query:
```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM tasks 
WHERE status = 'Done' 
AND completed_at BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30'
GROUP BY user_id 
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### **Team Performance**:
- Track the overall performance of a team (i.e., how many tasks have been completed by the team in total).
- Example query:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM tasks 
WHERE team_id = 'team-123' 
AND status = 'Done' 
AND completed_at BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30';
```

---

## **7. Reporting**

The dashboard can also offer **time-based reporting** for teams and tasks, which will help users understand performance trends over time.

### **Weekly/Monthly Reports**:
- Aggregate task completion data for weekly or monthly periods.
- Example query for weekly report:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM tasks 
WHERE status = 'Done' 
AND completed_at BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-07';
```

### **Average Task Completion Time**:
- Calculate the average time taken to complete tasks.
- Example query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM completed_at - created_at)) 
FROM tasks 
WHERE status = 'Done' 
AND completed_at IS NOT NULL;
```

## **8. Frontend Dashboard Display**

The frontend will consume the dashboard data provided by the backend and display it to the user in an easily digestible way. Here are the possible visualizations:

- **Pie Charts** for Task Status Distribution (To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Bar Graphs** for Weekly/Monthly Task Completion Rates.
- **Tables** for User Productivity and Team Metrics.
- **Line Graphs** for Tracking Task Completion over Time.

---

## **9. Permissions and Access Control**

Dashboard analytics will likely have different access levels based on user roles:
- **Admin**: Full access to all team and task analytics.
- **Manager**: Limited access to their team’s analytics (tasks, user productivity).
- **Member**: No access to team-wide analytics (only personal task progress).

---

## **Conclusion**

The **Dashboard and Analytics** feature will be a vital tool for users to track task progress, team performance, and individual productivity.
It will provide insights into areas that need attention, helping improve overall project management.
By integrating detailed reports and performance metrics, the dashboard will empower users to optimize task allocation, monitor deadlines, and enhance team collaboration.
