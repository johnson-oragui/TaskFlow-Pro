## **1. Core Concept of User Authentication**

User authentication is a fundamental part of any web application.
It ensures that users can securely register, log in, and interact with the application based on their roles and permissions.
In the context of **TaskFlow**, user authentication will include two key processes:

1. **User Registration**: Allow users to sign up by providing necessary information (email, password, etc.).
2. **User Login**: Provide a way for users to log in securely, typically using email/password or OAuth tokens.
3. **Token-based Authentication**: Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2 tokens to manage user sessions.
4. **Authorization**: Ensure that users only have access to specific resources and actions based on their roles (Admin, Manager, Member).

The authentication process will use **JWT** for stateless, secure user sessions, which is efficient for an API-based system like the one you're building.

## **2. Authentication Flow**

Here’s how the authentication system will work:

### **Step 1: Registration (Sign Up)**

- **Endpoint**: `POST /auth/register`
- **Request Payload**: Users will need to provide their email, username, and password.
  
- **Flow**:
  1. User submits a registration form.
  2. The backend checks if the email already exists.
  3. If the email is unique, the backend hashes the password using a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., `bcrypt`).
  4. Store the user’s hashed password and other relevant data in the database (e.g., email, username, role).
  5. A **welcome email** (optional) is sent to the user to confirm their registration.

- **Database Table: Users sample**:
```sql
users
-----
id              UUID (PK)
email           VARCHAR (Unique)
username        VARCHAR (Unique)
password_hash   VARCHAR
role            ENUM ('Admin', 'Manager', 'Member')
created_at      TIMESTAMP
```

### **Step 2: Login (Sign In)**

- **Endpoint**: `POST /auth/login`
- **Request Payload**: Users provide their email and password to log in.

- **Flow**:
  1. User submits their email and password.
  2. The backend checks if the email exists in the database.
  3. If the email exists, it compares the provided password with the stored hashed password.
  4. If the password is correct, the backend generates a JWT or OAuth2 token.
  5. The generated token is returned in the response.

- **Response Sample**:
```json
{
  "access_token": "JWT_TOKEN",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

### **Step 3: Token-based Authentication (JWT/OAuth2)**

- **JWT**: After successful login, the backend generates a JWT token. This token will contain a payload with user information and an expiration time (e.g., 1 hour).
- **Storage**: The JWT token can be stored in the frontend (e.g., in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`) and sent in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests.
  
  Example of JWT Header:
```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>"
}
```

- **JWT Token Verification**: On every request, the backend verifies the token’s validity by decoding it and checking its expiration time. If valid, the backend grants access to the requested resource.

- **OAuth2** (Optional): Could implement social login features (Google) using OAuth2 tokens. This can be used for users who prefer to authenticate via their social media accounts.

---

## **3. JWT Token Structure**

A typical **JWT** consists of three parts:

1. **Header**:
   - Contains information about the token’s type (JWT) and the algorithm used (e.g., `HS256`).
   
2. **Payload**:
   - Contains the claims (user data), such as user ID, username, email, and expiration time.
   - Example of Payload (decoded):
   ```json
   {
     "sub": "user-123",
     "email": "user@example.com",
     "role": "Manager",
     "exp": 1619537220
   }
   ```
   
3. **Signature**:
   - The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn’t changed along the way.
   - It’s created by signing the header and payload with a secret key.

---

## **4. Authorization (Roles and Permissions)**

Once the user is authenticated and a JWT is issued, we can use **roles** and **permissions** to authorize access to different parts of the application.

### **Roles**:
Roles are predefined levels of access within the system. In **TaskFlow**, the following roles can be used:
1. **Admin**: Full access to all resources and user management.
2. **Manager**: Limited access to managing tasks, teams, and users within the team.
3. **Member**: Access to tasks and responsibilities within the team.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The backend will implement RBAC to manage permissions based on user roles. For example:
  - **Admin**: Can access all team data, tasks, and manage other users.
  - **Manager**: Can create, update, and delete tasks, assign tasks to team members, but cannot manage other users or teams.
  - **Member**: Can only view and update their own tasks.

### **Authorization Middleware**:
- When a user makes a request, the backend will check their **role** embedded in the JWT token to ensure they have the required permissions to access the requested resource.
  
- **Example Middleware Logic**:
  - Check if the **JWT** token is present in the request header.
  - Verify if the token is valid and not expired.
  - Extract the user’s **role** from the token and compare it against the required role for the resource.
  - If the user has sufficient permissions, proceed with the request. If not, return an **Unauthorized (401)** or **Forbidden (403)** response.

---

## **5. Refresh Tokens (Optional)**

For long-lived sessions, implementation of **refresh tokens** to allow users to obtain new access tokens without needing to log in again.

- **Flow**:
  1. The user logs in and receives an access token and a refresh token.
  2. The access token expires after a certain time (e.g., 1 hour).
  3. When the access token expires, the user can send the refresh token to the backend to obtain a new access token.

- **Refresh Token Endpoint**: `POST /auth/refresh`
- **Request Payload**: `refresh_token`
  
  The backend will verify the refresh token and, if valid, issue a new access token.

---

## **6. Password Hashing and Security**

To ensure password security:
- **Hashing**: Passwords would never be stored in plaintext. A secure hashing algorithm like **bcrypt** would be used to hash passwords before storing them in the database.
  
- **Salt**: The `bcrypt` algorithm adds a **salt** (random data) to the password before hashing, making it much harder for attackers to guess or reverse-engineer the original password.

### **Password Hashing**:
- When a user registers, their password is hashed:
- When a user logs in, the backend compares the hashed version of the entered password to the stored hash:

## **7. API Endpoints for Authentication**

| Method | Endpoint          | Description                                          |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/auth/register`   | Register a new user with email, username, and password |
| POST   | `/auth/login`      | Login a user and return an access token              |
| POST   | `/auth/refresh`    | Refresh the access token using a valid refresh token |
| POST   | `/auth/logout`     | Logout the user (invalidate the token on the server-side) |

---

## **8. Security Considerations**

- **Secure Storage**: Ensure the JWT token is stored securely on the frontend (e.g., `HttpOnly` cookies or `localStorage` with caution).
- **HTTPS**: Ensure the entire authentication flow is performed over HTTPS to prevent token interception.
- **Token Expiration**: Set reasonable expiration times for JWT tokens and refresh tokens to minimize the risk of token theft.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks on login.

---

## **9. Frontend Integration**

On the frontend side, users will interact with the authentication system by:
- **Sign Up**: Using a registration form to submit their credentials.
- **Login**: Submitting their credentials (email and password) to the login endpoint and saving the JWT token for future API requests.
- **Logout**: Invalidating the JWT token by either deleting it from storage or making an explicit logout request to the backend.
- **Token Management**: Storing the JWT token securely and sending it in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests.

---

## **Conclusion**

The **User Authentication** system in the **TaskFlow** backend is the gateway to managing secure access for users based on their roles.
By implementing JWT tokens, role-based access control, and optional OAuth2 integration, we can ensure both security and flexibility for users.
This will allow users to securely sign up, log in, and access different parts of the application based on their roles, while maintaining a smooth user experience.
